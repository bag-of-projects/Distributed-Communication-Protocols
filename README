Distributed Communication Protocols

Env: Java, Unix
Tecnologies: Thread, locking, RMI

Details :

Built communication protocols using Socket Programming and RMI for distributed systems as part of the “Distributed Operating Systems” course. The protocols
used client-server communication as well as remote methods with the concept of a broker serving as the service repository:

1. Perform distributed computation using multi-threaded programming and Barrier Synchronization
2. Implement a P2P Chord, which is a protocol to support a scalable peer-to-peer (P2P) lookup service for Internet applications
3 Perform Chord protocols in a dynamic environment where nodes can join and leave at anytimeThis project implements a P2P chord protocol. It perform Chord protocols in a dynamic environment where nodes can join and leave at anytime.
