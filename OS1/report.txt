This is an interesting project. It gave me a better insite into handling 
threads and sockets likewise. Sending data from one node to another 
proved to be the most challenging for me. As I had to encode the entire 
message into byte array. This demanded that we include the message 
length in the message itself. At the receiving node, we had to extract 
the message by a decoding process. This encoding - decoding ensured that 
the tokens and messages are send across correctly. 

The project description requires that each node wait for 5 seconds 
before sending data. This in my opinion does not guarantee a successful 
connection. Instead, if we reorder the starting sequence of the nodes, 
then we need not wait the extra 5 seconds.
